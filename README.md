# Photo To ACSII
 Converts any photo to ACSII

To use this, please install Pillow and use any image you would like (JPG, or PNG).

In this example, I will be using this photo:


![alt text](https://github.com/footloops/Photo-To-ACSII/blob/main/PhotoToACSII/HandsomeCat.jpg)


To run this, please download all of this as a zip, then proceed to the file "PhotoToACSII" and run "main.py"
It will ask you to paste the path to the photo, but if the photo is in the same file as the program, then all you have to do is type the name. Ex: HandsomeCat.jpg

Once it runs, it will output a .txt file and the resulting .txt file should look like this if you used my example image:
![Click Me!](https://github.com/footloops/Photo-To-ACSII/blob/main/PhotoToACSII/ascii_image.txt)

This couldn't have been done without the great tutorial of ![Javascript Jeep](https://medium.com/javascript-dots/python-ascii-art-generator-60ba9eb559d7)
The tutorial program didn't work so I edited it and added different operations.
